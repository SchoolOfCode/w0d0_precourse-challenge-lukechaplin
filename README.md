# Why I Chose David Lynch

I chose to create my tribute page about David Lynch as I am huge fan of Americana, having grown up in the USA during my childhood and seeing the disconnect between the glossy suface detail of America and its actual less than glossy underside.

## My Reflections on making my tribute page include:

1. Appreciating ID tags to link to CSS styling
2. Getting a grasp of the syntax needed in both HTML & CSS
3. Understanding the basics of git and command lines and that you can acces this through an IDE like VCS
